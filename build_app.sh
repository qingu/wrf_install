IMPORTANT:
   The order of building apps may need be altered in your case since
   this package doesn't resolve dependencies (yet). So change app_list
   variable in this file to control order of building or call the above
   options one by one manually.

NOTE:
   This script is just a wrapper for indivial builing scripts which are
   located in "build" directory. So how please read them and change them
   freely according to your needs.
